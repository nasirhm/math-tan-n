# C++ Implementations for "tan(n) > n" Problem.

## Usage of <cmath> Package

cmath is a library providing the ability to compute the `tan(n)` function.

**TODO**:
- Research how `tan()` is defined in the stdlib package.

This directory contains the code to evaluate the `tan(n)` for integers in the following interval [`1`, `4285797387061825747646013`] (Using a 64-bit unsigned {Positive} integer) to match with the integer sequence defined on OEIS.

It writes the solutions to a comma-separated file `tan-n-sol.txt`.
